<h1>Angular Components</h1>
	<p>Components are the main building blocks of an Angular application. You can think of each component as being its own custom HTML element which can be inserted into a page at will. These custom elements can even have defined Inputs which act like the element's attributes and allow you to dynamically adjust the contents of a component when using it.</p>
	<p>Each component is comprised of its own HTML layout, CSS styling, and TypeScript code. These three parts can be self-contained across 3 separate files, or the HTML and CSS portions can be combined into the component's TypeScript (.ts) file.</p>
